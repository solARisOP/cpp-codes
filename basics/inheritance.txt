// single inheritance --> a single class is derived from a single base class.
// multiple inheritance --> a class is derived from several base classes.
// hierarchical inheritance --> several classes are derived from a single base class.
// multilevel inheritance --> a class is derived from already derived class.
// hybrid inheritance --> it is a combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance,
   however one of the parent class is not a base class.
